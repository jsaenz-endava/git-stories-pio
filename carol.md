# This is my story 

1. And I was there, lost in the beauty of the sand, no light disturbing my thoughts. The deep dark, so comfortable for my eyes, fills everything with emptiness. But I was good; everything was so quiet and calm. The sand surrounding my being changes form and gives me a rough and endless hug.
2. I was okay, and I was tranquil. Time passed, and neither sadness nor happiness appeared in the scene. It was a perpetual unaltered status of nothing. But, is this life? Am I living? How would it be to cry, to laugh, to grow? Why do I have those concepts in my mind but never experience them?
3. I started to be uncomfortable with the things I used to be okay with; suddenly, I began to move everywhere,   I didn't know if it was going up, down, right, or left, but when I started to find my surroundings warmer and warmer, I decided to go there, where the sensation was hotter. And then I could sand change, and now it was wet. It was weird; I couldn't breathe. I thought I was dying.
